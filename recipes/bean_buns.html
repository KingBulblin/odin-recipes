        <h3>The following dessert is a recipe from the movie <em>Spirited Away</em>. This copycat recipe is by "Soph" an editor over at <a href="https://www.unculturedpalate.com">UnculturedPalate.com</a>. This recipe involves steaming a bun filled with red bean paste filling to give you a soft, gooey and sweet roll similar to Studio Ghibli's <em>Spirited Away</em>.</h3>
        
        <div class="list1">
        <h4 class="borderheaders">Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 2/5 cup of all purpose flour (300g)</li>
            <li>40g sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp sugar tolerant (instant) yeast</li>
            <li>180 ml warm milk (35 C) or 150 ml of warmed water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>200 g red bean paste filling</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="list2">
        <h4 class="borderheaders">Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a pot and put it on low, low heat</li>
            <li>Add the milk and use a thermometer to heat the milk to 35 C</li>
            <li>Add to a large enough bowl with the flour, sugar, yeast, veggie oil, and salt.</li>
            <li>Mix this around with a spoon or so (or a mixer with paddles for kneading on) before switching to your hands to knead the dough.</li>
            <li>Get everything worked in nice and good before setting it in a room temperature area for an hour for the dough to rise. What we did was we set the oven to 250 F and put a dish towel over the bowl. We set this on top of the oven to get the heat.</li>
            <li>When about 20 minutes was left we added water to the steamer and set it to start steaming. I'll cover this later, but you might want to think carefully about this step.</li>
            <li>After an hour, add like a tablespoon or 2 more of the flour and knead some more.</li>
            <li>When it seems like it's not too rough and you're praying what you've seen on Great British Baking Show is sufficient for judging it, break this up into about 6 little dough balls. Maybe 8 if you want it really small.</li>
            <li>Use your fingers to flatten these out but make the edges thinner than the center. I started from the center and pushed/pinched outward until it seemed wide enough, that it could fold into a ball again</li>
            <li>Spoon the red bean paste into the center and close it up nice and tight. Tighter than a convent if you can so nothing gets out, not even Satan.</li>
            <li>Flip these over and shape into a dome as much as you can.</li>
            <li>Line the steamer bowl with parchment paper and learn from my mistake of not doing that.</li>
            <li>So here, we were supposed to place them, have the steamer off and let them prove for another 20 minutes. I didn't read the instructions all the way through. So we just went straight to steaming for 20 minutes. This worked great! They still tasted good and were enjoyable but we won't know what would have happened had we listened.</li>
            <li>When they are done steaming, turn off the steamer and leave them in there for about 5 more minutes.</li>
        </ol>
